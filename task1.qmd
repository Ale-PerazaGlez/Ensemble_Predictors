## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

file <- '2022-2023 Football Player Stats.csv'
df <- read_delim(file, delim = ";", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ".", grouping_mark = ",", encoding = "Windows-1252"),
                     col_types = "ifffffiiiiidi")
# str(df)
# 
# summary(df)
```

```{r}
# Some players are repeated because they change position/team/league
df[which(df$RecProg == max(df$RecProg)), ]


length(df$Player)
length(unique(df$Player))

df %>% filter(Player == "Matthis Abline")
df %>% filter(Player == "Naouirou Ahamada")
```

```{r}
library(skimr)
skim(df)
```

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)

numeric_df <- dplyr::select(df, where(is.numeric))
cormat <- round(cor(numeric_df),2)

high_cor_idx <- apply(cormat, 1, 
                 function(x) any(abs(x) > 0.85 & abs(x) < 1))
corrplot(cor(numeric_df[, high_cor_idx]), type = "upper", method = "circle")

```

We have a lot of clusters of highly correlated variables, this was expected.

```{r}
# I'd say that we should remove the red cards a player have and maybe their fault
df_ <- df %>% dplyr::select(-c(`2CrdY`, CrdR, Player, Fls))
numeric_df <- dplyr::select(df_, where(is.numeric))

#' Testing only with numeric variables for now. 
#' Using factors end up making the plot way too cluttered

#Create training set
train <- numeric_df %>% sample_frac(.70)

#Create test set
test  <- anti_join(numeric_df, train, by = 'Rk')
```

```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
model1 <- rpart(CrdY ~., data = train)

# plot(model1)
rpart.plot(model1)
```
